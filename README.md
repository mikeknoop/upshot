UpShot
======

About the Fork
--------------

This fork removes the Dropbox dependencies alltogether and replaced it with a custom URL upload setting.

This fork also includes a `.app` binary distributed with the repo. You can simply install the file "UpShot.app" into your Applications folder.

This is intended to be set to a URL on a server you own, running code which does the following:

1. Receive a POST request as application/json
2. Store the passed Base64-encoded image. It will be POSTed as `{'image': base64(...)}`
3. Return a publicly accessible URL where the image can be found, as application/json, like this: `{'link': 'http://example.com/.../5Eb3.png'}`

The rest of this readme pertains to the original UpShot documentation.

UpShot is an automatic screen shot uploader for OS X, written in Python.

For sharing, UpShot uses Dropbox's Public folder, giving you maximum control over what you share.

**For more information and to download UpShot, visit the [UpShot website][upshot].** If you want to contribute to UpShot or check out its source code, read on.

Features
--------
The basic workflow is this:

* UpShot listens to a new screenshot being created with OS X's default screenshot function.
* It moves that screenshot to your public Dropbox folder.
* It copies that public Dropbox URL to your clipboard.

Other features currently include:

* Custom domain name support
* randomized filenames


Contributing
------------
UpShot is an open source project. [Issues / pull requests][issues], feedback, feature requests, â€¦, are greatly appreciated!

Compiling it
------------
UpShot uses a [fabric][fabric] script for build and maintenance tasks:

1. Create a [virtualenv][virtualenv].
2. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. ``fab build``

This will build an app package in the directory ``dist``. You can execute it from there. If you want to see console output, start it via ``fab run`` instead.

[fabric]: http://fabfile.org/
[virtualenv]: http://www.virtualenv.org/

> *Note:* Your virtualenv might not contain libpython2.x.dylib and thus cause an error. You can simply ``cd $VIRTUAL_ENV`` and ``ln -s /path/to/libpython2.x.dylib`` as a workaround.


Configuration
-------------
The latest version has a configuration screen, but not everything is configurable yet. For a full list, check out ``upshot.py`` for constants. You can override all those in a (new) file ``settings_local.py``.
